[ ] Implementation:
  [o3] Add RDFS schema for AC models.
  [x] Rewrite of AC simulator using RDF models.
  [ ] Store structural equations using IRIs and internal structure.
  [ ] Causal formulas using IRIs and internal structure.
  [x] RDF term writing in signature HTML table.
  [o1] Remove old models.
  [o1] Check why simulations no longer work.
  [o1] Display causal formula in Web interface.
  [o2] Make causes in table clickable and color cause in graphic.
  [o2] Return causal path next to cuase. Color causal path as well as cause.
  [ ] Allow models to be entered via an HTML form.
[ ] Modeling:
  [ ] Golden standard: a collection of examples.
  [ ] Expressivity: can we express common intuitions in terms of causation?
  [ ] CLI + Web UI
  [ ] Create models
  [ ] Combine models
[ ] Modeling environment:
  [ ] Quantifying over contexts (potential/actual causer).
  [ ] Concept mapping UI.
  [ ] Top-level language translation into causal formalism.
  [ ] Unit testing: example models from literature.
[ ] Paper:
  [ ] Introduction
  [ ] Related work:
    [ ] Actual Causation (Pearl, Halpern)
    [ ] Causality in ethics (Aristotle, wierd paper, determinism in philosophy of mind).
    [ ] Responsibility (as counterfactual, Frankfurt)
    [ ] Lifestyle differentiation in health care
  [ ] Methodology/Approach:
    [ ] Conceptual  analysis: use of an existing axiomatization of causality for modeling responsibility as causation.
  [ ] Implementation: modeling interface for responsibility as causation.
  [ ] Evaluation:
    [ ] Taking an existing example from the ethics domain it is possible to construe a consistent model that supports purported intuitions.
  [ ] Conclusion & future work
