The following is in line with [Halpern & Pearl 2005](http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/843.short):\r\n\r\n  1. Both the cause and what is caused must be the case.\r\n  2. The endogenous variables can be partitioned into a causal path *Z* and the rest *W*, such that the counterfactual can be shown for some assigment of *W*. Furthermore, all the changing value of the caused in the counterfactual cannot be acchieved by *W* in the actual case.\r\n  3. The cause is minimal.\r\n\r\n# A simple example of two causes\r\n\r\nLet's take some examples from [Halpern & Hitchcock 2011](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2652): lightning may cause a forest to burn; and so does dropping a burning match stick. We represent that either cause suffices with the following structural equation:\r\n\r\n> *F #= max(L,M)*\r\n\r\nIf both causes are needed, *max* would be replaced by *min* (i.e., conjunction as opposed to disjunction).\r\n\r\n![](https://rawgit.com/wouterbeek/Actual-Causation/master/img/forest_fire.svg \"Trumping example\")\r\n\r\n# The case of preemption\r\n\r\nSuppose a patient has the bad habit of smoking and is developing emphsema in response.\r\nThis would eventually\r\n\r\n![](https://rawgit.com/wouterbeek/Actual-Causation/master/img/billy_suzy_bottle.svg \"Billy & Suzy & bottle\")\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/wouterbeek/Actual-Causation/master/img/trumping.svg \"Trumping example\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
